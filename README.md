# xradix

A fast, clean, tested, and documented implementation of the [Radix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) data structure.

Also, comes with special hooks for various tree-traversals starting at the first node matching a given prefix. These include depth-first (pre-order and post-order) and breadth-first.

This data structure is often the optimal choice for autocomplete.

## Examples

```{javascript}
// TODO FIXME
const { RadixTree } = require('xradix');
const rt = new RadixTree();
```
